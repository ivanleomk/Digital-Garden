Note that `their` \n\n\n\u003e Imparfait vs Pass√© Composse\n\nEg. `J'ai v√©cu au Maroc` does not work, you need to use the imparfait?\n\n- **Situation 1** : The easy test is to figure out the difference between `I Lived vs I used to live`  (Eg. An old action/state)\n\n\t- I used to live in Tiong Bahru as a child can replace I lived in Tiong Bahru BUT `I lived in paris for 3 months last year` cannot be replaced by  `I used to live in Paris`\n\nWe cannot use the imparfait when\n\n- We are refering to a discrete action or a series of discrete actions (Eg.

Therefore instead of focusing on maximizing every minute with an infinitely long list of demands, consider choosing your projects carefully and purposefully. Your existence is a short but beautiful one.\n\n# üé® Impressions\n\n## How I Discovered It\n\nLibby\n\n## Who Should Read It?\n\nPeople who are constantly stressed and suffer from anxiety\n\n# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me\n\nI think I definitely thought a little deeper and harder about the way I viewed life after reading this book. I've always lived my life comparing myself to others and berating myself for choosing perhaps sub-optimal choices because of my personal situation. It is comforting however, to come to this realisation at a young age of 25. \n\nI think ultimately it makes the stronger case for a balanced approach towards living life - that of enjoying it for the present while simultaneously keeping a look out for the future. While we might have no control over what we might do in the future or in the past in this very moment, we can definitely still set ourselves up for success with slow but precise steps.\n\nIs it even worth anything in the end? I'm not really sure. But I do know that I feel the most alive when I work on things that are intellectually stimulating and difficult and so I'd like to continue working on it with my limited time.\n\n\n# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes\n\n\u003e We treat everything we‚Äôre doing‚Äîlife itself, in other words‚Äîas valuable only insofar as it lays the groundwork for something else ... and indeed there‚Äôs a sense in which every moment of life is a ‚Äúlast time.‚Äù It arrives; you‚Äôll never get it again‚Äîand once it‚Äôs passed, your remaining supply of moments will be one smaller than before. To treat all these moments solely as stepping-stones to some future moment is to demonstrate a level of obliviousness to our real situation that would be jaw-dropping if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that we all do it, all the time.. We choose to treat time in this self-defeatingly instrumental way, and we do so because it helps us maintain the feeling of being in omnipotent control of our lives ... Because he never has to ‚Äúcash out‚Äù the meaningfulness of his actions in the here and now, the purposive man gets to imagine himself an omnipotent god, whose influence over reality extends infinitely off into the future; he gets to feel as though he‚Äôs truly the master of his time\n\u003e \n\u003e **We cannot get anything out of life**. There is no outside where we could take this thing\n\n\n\u003e The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. Here‚Äôs one way of putting things in perspective: the first modern humans appeared on the plains of Africa at least 200,000 years ago, and scientists estimate that life, in some form, will persist for another 1.5 billion years or more, until the intensifying heat of the sun condemns the last organism to death. But you? Assuming you live to be eighty, you‚Äôll have had about four thousand weeks\n\n\u003e Surely only somebody who‚Äôd failed to notice how remarkable it is that anything is, in the first place, would take their own being as such a given‚Äîas if it were something they had every right to have conferred upon them, and never to have taken away. So maybe it‚Äôs not that you‚Äôve been cheated out of an unlimited supply of time; maybe it‚Äôs almost incomprehensibly miraculous to have been granted any time at all.\n\n\n\n# üìí Summary + Notes\n\n\u003e Tl;dr : Life is short and we have a finite amount of energy and time. Spend it on the things that matter to you and be deliberate about it. Even if you think you've done nothing but waste time, realise that nothing can come out of life, there is no place to bring our accomplishments to. But even so, it makes a bigger case for being deliberate about how we spend our limited time with the ones we love and cherish.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-30T01:41:56.96007735Z","tags":null}}
