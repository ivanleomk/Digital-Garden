> These are my notes on the B2 Examination

The B2 Exam comprises the following bits

| Section               | Description | Duration |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Oral Comprehension    | 25 Points   | 0.5      |
| Reading Comprehension | 25 Points   | 1        |
| Writing Exercise      | 25 Points   | 1        |
| Oral Exercise         | 25 Points   | 0.3 ( Around 20 minutes )      |   

Generally, most people online seem to recommend the Alter-Ego textbook but since I already have the Edito, I'll probbaly just stuck to that


>[!IMPORTANT]
The Delf B2 Exam will happen in Singapore around 14 March, that gives us about 9 months to prepare

Here are some of the big issues I currently face

- Insufficient Vocabulary
- Imperfect Conjugations
- A lack of choice phrases to use in order to sound more fluent and articulate in French
